Summary:
TikTok, owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, has been at the center of controversy in the U.S. for four years now due to concerns about user data. A number of investors are competing for the opportunity to purchase the app. The platform’s U.s. business could have its valuation soar to upward of $60 billion. In January, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACA), commonly referred to as “the TikTok ban.” TikTok made a formal announcement that it would likely have to go dark on January 19. On January 20, Trump signed an executive order that postponed the Tik Tok ban for 75 days.
