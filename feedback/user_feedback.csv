summary_feedback,kinda Good !!!!...,"TikTok, owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, has been at the center of controversy in the U.S. for four years now due to concerns about user data potentially being accessed by the Chinese government. Just this past month, the app experienced a temporary outage in the U.S. that left millions of users in suspense before it was quickly restored.
TikTok returned to the App Store and Google Play Store last month.
Nonetheless, TikTok’s future remains uncertain, and a number of investors are competing for the opportunity to purchase the app. The platform’s U.S. business could have its valuation soar to upward of $60 billion, as estimated by CFRA Research’s senior vice president, Angelo Zino.
To fully understand this high-stakes drama, we’ll first revisit the timeline of TikTok’s tumultuous relationship with the U.S. government, which resulted in various legal battles and negotiations.
The drama first began in August 2020, when Trump signed an executive order to ban transactions with parent company ByteDance.
A month later, Trump’s administration sought to force a sale of TikTok’s U.S. operations to a U.S.-based company. The leading contenders included Microsoft, Oracle, and Walmart. However, a U.S. judge temporarily blocked Trump’s executive order, allowing TikTok to continue operating while the legal battle unfolded.
Things began to progress even more last year following the transition to the Biden administration. The U.S. House of Representatives, in an overwhelming 360-58 vote, passed the legislation against TikTok. On April 23, 2024, the Senate passed the bill.
Shortly after, President Joe Biden signed the bill requiring TikTok to be sold or banned. In response, TikTok sued the U.S. government, challenging the constitutionality of the ban and arguing the app and its American users were having their First Amendment rights violated. The company has consistently denied that it poses a security threat, asserting that its data stored in the U.S. complies with all local laws.
On December 27, 2024, Trump opposed the potential ban of TikTok in a court filing, stating he could find a way to keep the app in the U.S. This stance was a stark contrast to his approach during his first presidency and presented a surprising turn of events for TikTok.
In January, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACA), commonly referred to as “the TikTok ban.” TikTok made a formal announcement that it would likely have to go dark on January 19.
Although TikTok indeed shut itself down in the U.S. when the act came into effect, it didn’t last long. The app came back online less than 12 hours later. The platform noted, “As a result of President Trump’s efforts, TikTok is back in the U.S.”
On January 20, Trump signed an executive order that postponed the TikTok ban for 75 days. This extension provides the app with additional time to either sell a stake in the platform or reach an agreement with Trump. His goal is to achieve a 50-50 ownership arrangement between ByteDance and a U.S. company.
More recently, in early March, Trump told reporters that his administration was in talks with four different groups who are interested in buying the platform, per Reuters.
No definitive deal has been reached yet for the sale of the platform, but we could find out very soon.
Below is a list of the investor groups and companies rumored to be potential buyers of TikTok’s U.S. operations. (Surprisingly, Elon Musk is not among them.)
The People’s Bid for TikTok is a consortium organized by Project Liberty founder Frank McCourt, who is also the former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers. Investment firm Guggenheim Securities and the law firm Kirkland & Ellis are helping to assemble the bid. The main mission of The People’s Bid to acquire TikTok is to prioritize privacy and data control, taking an open source approach.
Supporters involved include:
Jesse Tinsley, the CEO and founder of Employer.com, is leading a consortium of American investors. Last month, Tinsley announced a $30 billion all-cash offer to acquire TikTok’s U.S. operations.
The story has been updated after publication to include new interested parties.

Travis Kalanick, the former CEO of Uber, made it clear on Wednesday: he believes the company’s decision to abandon its autonomous driving program was a mistake. Said Kalanick at the Abundance Summit in L.A., “Look, [new management] killed the autonomous car project we had going on. At the time, we were really only behind Waymo but probably catching up, and we were going to pass them in short order . . . I wasn’t running the company when that happened, but you know, you could say, ‘Wish we had an autonomous ride-sharing product right now. That would be great.’”
Uber sold its self-driving unit in a reported fire sale to the self-driving tech developer Aurora in 2020, three years after Kalanick was forced to step down. At the time, it made sense; autonomous driving was bleeding cash, and Uber had already spent hundreds of millions of dollars on the effort. Now, Waymo’s self-driving cars are tooling around the Bay Area, Los Angeles, Phoenix and popping up in new markets.
Waymo recently partnered in Austin with Uber, and Uber is betting its platform will be critical in growing the service. But business is business, and partnerships falter. If Waymo decides it doesn’t need a middleman, Uber, once the future of transportation, could find itself stuck in reverse.

Food delivery startup Wonder is acquiring media company Tastemade for around $90 million, according to The Wall Street Journal. Founded in 2012, Tastemade produces food, travel, and home videos and operates several free, ad-supported streaming television (FAST) channels.
The acquisition gives Wonder access to a content studio, production company, and advertising business. Wonder will leverage all of these assets to promote its brands to a wider audience, the company says.
The deal marks Wonder’s latest step toward its mission to create a mealtime “super app.” Wonder founder and CEO Marc Lore, who was previously Walmart’s head of e-commerce, wants to turn Wonder into an AI app that not only tells you what to eat but also automatically orders it for you from Wonder kitchens.
With this acquisition, users may soon be able to place a delivery order for a dish that they’re seeing being prepared by a chef on a Tastemade streaming channel.
Wonder’s past acquisitions include Blue Apron and Grubhub. The startup has raised a total of $1.6 billion to date.
